# Timetracker
This is my own timetracker which I built with the help of ChatGPT. Already i can say, that the next time I'll do something like this I will definitely work with Git, because this was the horror. Also I spent way to much time on this instead of studying for university, for which it was originally intended.

If you want to have acces to my database, just write me an email to j.schultevels@gmail.com

*Finally*
After around 40 hours (fortunately I can track from now on and tell the exact hours) I've "completed" my chatgpt timetracker.
It's far from perfect, as especially the mobile part isn't anywhere near good at all, which was originally my intention.
But still it is ready for use and I've got a midterm in 3 days, so like I finally need to stop (felt like a really long trip as the hours just went by).
